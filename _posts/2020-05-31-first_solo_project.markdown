I'm done. Got it to work. It's 4:00pm Central about 4 days after I started this endeavor. Might I say I started on the wrong foot because I accidentally chose an API that was used in Michael's(cohort lead) video walk-through of this project, unknowingly.  So that put me about 3 days behind because I had to look for a different data source to not run the risk of making my CLI too similar to what he had done. 

So I landed on the Star Wars API. Huge database about the 6 film universe(last 3 have yet to be added, doubt they ever will be given all the backlash, story for another time) that has very detailed information on films, characters, starships, planets, vehicles, etc. So, I set out to start coding, except, I went with the left foot again and found myself not having a clue where or how to start a repository as it has been done for me all this time via Learn.co. So I asked my cohort mate Vedran for some guidance since I'd gotten familiar with him through having a code pairing session a week earlier and he pointed me to Michael's videos of the build and how these took you step-by-step on how to get a working application. 

Ah, finally on the right track putting one foot in front of the other, or, in this case, typing one block of code after the other.  All of this within 24 hours that took me through one night of little sleep and lots of worry that I would not finish this on time and be set back.  However, the next day after setting me project repository up correctly on GitHub I began to gain confidence again.  Knowing that with this structure I have been able to make huge strides in learning as compared to when I said I would learn in on my own I put an application together that met all requirements. I know it's not the prettiest or most effecient piece of code I'll ever write but I am proud that I finished it and show cased some of what I have learned. 

I was so confident that I tried doing more than just the "first level" data display that is required but for the sake of my sanity I decided to leave it as it was and that I would likely later revisit the repository and actually add the functionality.  All in all I'm glad with my project and the things it has made me realize about myself as a software engineer and I can only imagine the things I'll make once I have the full program under my belt and continue to learn more and more in my career.
