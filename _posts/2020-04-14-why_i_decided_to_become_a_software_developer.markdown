I am a 26 y.o. father and husband who happens to have a B.S. in Mechanical and Energy Engineering and is working towards a M.S. in Biomedical Engineering.  While I am doing all this I have not had the fortune to find an opportunity in either of these fields so I work part-time at Discount Tire while taking classes to finish my M.S. I made a promise to my wife to give her and our children the best life in my possibilities As I progressed through both my degrees I got subtle hints that I still was missing some part to my education that would really solidify it and allow me to be the most well-rounded candidate.  

It began as a simple required class as an introduction to C++. It came naturally to me but as I was focused more on mechanical engineering I did not think delving more into it would benefit me. In later semesters I was introduced to MatLab and that is when it became clear coding would have to be a heavy part in my career as more assignments used software like MatLab and coding in general.  So, as I went into my first year of my M.S. in 2018 I also decided I would need to learn to code. I began on my own but soon realized I would need some structure because I couldn't focus on my own so I am now here.
