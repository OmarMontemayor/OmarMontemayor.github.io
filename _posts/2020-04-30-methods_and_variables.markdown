**Metaphors for Life**

From the moment we wake up our actions and thoughts emulate that of variables and methods in code.  Our brain gets inout through our ears of that dreaded sound that tells us it's time to get out of our comfy bed and get ready for yet ANOTHER day of the same.  So, we open our eyes and reach to shut the sound off in code much of the same happens. Most of the time its dormant but ready to go when called upon.  Just like we can conjure up breakfast by grabbing_a_bowl, pouring_cereal_in, and pouring_milk_in we could make code that could make a virtual "person" do the same.  

Of course there's days when we wake up and everything goes wrong. We could have woken up late, spilled coffee on our dress shirt while rushing to the interview, someone could have  cut you off and almost cause a major accident, gotten a rejection letter from your top school or dream job. Same with our code. More days than not we will likely be looking at buggy code. I've come to terms with that today that we need to become proficient in reading the error messages life and code sends us and dig in and solve them one at a time.  If only there were actual clear, concise error messages for life...I bet we'd be a lot closer to peace...or maybe closer to another world war cause error messages can sometimes just take you over the edge. 

Nevertheless,  let's continue to take in all of lives variables and run our methods to execute a beautiful program called Life cause that's all we can do.
