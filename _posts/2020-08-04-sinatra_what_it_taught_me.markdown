After completing the CLI project and being asked to showcase it with my cohort because my assessment went so well, it's safe to say I went into this module confident and maybe a little "cocky". Boy, did that bite me about 3/4 of the way. I hit a bit of a wall and because of life and my personality I became a little disengaged. Somehow, I managed to trudge through it and despite getting a week behind on the material I caught up and came up with an idea for this looking through Thumbtack.  A simple version that would help homeowners keep track of their home improvement projects. I chose this cause it seems like a website I can take all the way through the rest of this course and build on it and maybe some day make it public and connect homeowners with resources to complete their projects either themselves or by using a contractor.  

Anyway, that is a ways away and this process showed me I have a lot to learn. Mainly, as a Full-stack developer I need to get over the fact that I do not like the front-end of development very much. While the logic of displaying information and manipulating databases is difficult I find that enjoyable and challenging to the point where I can feel my limits being tested as a developer. The opposite is true for front-end(CSS and HTML), I find tedious and uninspiring when I work with. I have to say that was my least favorite part of this project is working with that and trying to make everything look uniform. These last couple weeks showed me I can get past that feeling and still produce a functional website that could later on be a good starting point for a business and it's only up from here.
